# The-Go-Model-Pressure-Project
Official GMPP 

The Go-Model pressure project is designed to intake SMOG-server gromacs files and use a series of simulations to find the folding transition and develop a folding landscape for the given system. 

The landscapes will be generated with a series of combinations of the RMSF, native contacts, and radius of gyration with the dimensionless free energy calculated with the WHAM algorithm. 

Command line: python GMPP.py /path/to/smog/files.
